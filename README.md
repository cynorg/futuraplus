futuraplus [BROKEN]
==========
Hello there! If you've come to check out Futura Plus, first of all - thank you! Second of all, I'm sad to inform you that Futura Plus had come accross some pretty nasty bugs (location mostly) and had to be taken down as I didn't want people to be running broken software. Feel free to do what you wish still with the source - the newest and hopefully bug free version should be published for Monday.

Has: 
-12/24 hour support 

-Animations for minute/hour change and boot-up 

-Hourly weather 

--Remembers what the last temperature and condition was 

-Bluetooth and watch battery status -Vibration on bluetooth disconnect, weather update, and bluetooth reconnect
